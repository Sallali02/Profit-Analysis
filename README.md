# Profit Analysis and Departmental Insights Using SQL and Power BI
This project is centered around performing a detailed analysis of departmental profitability and resource allocation across various projects within a company. Using SQL for querying datasets and Power BI for visual representation, the goal was to analyze how project budgets, salaries, and revenues are distributed across departments, and provide clear insights into each department's financial status. The tools used for this project included SQL (Microsfot SQL Server) and Power BI.

# Goal: 
The purpose of this project was to: </br>
1. Track departmental and project-level costs, including project budgets, salary costs, and overall revenues. </br>
2. Present key insights regarding the profitability of various departments.</br>
3. Visualize salary distributions across different job titles.</br>
4. Analyze project status (upcoming or completed) and determine their financial impact.</br>
5. Create a user-friendly dashboard that offers detailed employee and project insights at a glance.</br>

# SQL Queries and Data Handling: 

Using SQL, I merged data from several tables including employees, departments, project_assignments, and project_status to form a unified dataset for analysis. The query integrated key employee and department information with their assigned projects, along with the status of each project (whether it’s completed or upcoming).</br>
The dataset also included:</br>
- Employee information such as employee ID, job title, department, and salary.</br>
- Departmental data including department names and goals.</br>
- Project details such as project names, budget allocations, and statuses (upcoming or completed).</br>

The SQL query created a comprehensive view of how employees were assigned to various projects, their respective department goals, and the status of those projects. </br>This data was later visualized in Power BI.</br>

# Dashboard Insights (Power BI): 

The interactive Power BI dashboard was designed to allow users to:</br>
- View department-specific data such as total project costs, salaries, and revenues.</br>
- Compare salary distributions by job title within the company.</br>
- Track project budgets and identify which departments are driving the most revenue.</br>
- Understand the financial breakdown of completed and upcoming projects, categorized by department.</br>
- Drill down into individual employee data, viewing details like job title, department, salary, and headshot, offering personalized insights.</br>

The dashboard provides decision-makers with a high-level overview of the company’s financial health and operational efficiency across departments. It also features a project-by-project breakdown to assess which projects yield the most profitability.</br>
